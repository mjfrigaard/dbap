<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `dbap` is to demonstrate debugging functions within a shiny
application package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/),
[`shiny::testServer()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/shiny/html/testServer.html),
and RStudioâ€™s debugger. Check out [this blog
post](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/posts/debugging/) for more
information.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mjfrigaard/dbap")

The examples for this package are contained in the vignettes.
