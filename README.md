<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `dbap` is to demonstrate how to test a shiny application
package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/),
[`shiny::testServer()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/shiny/html/testServer.html),
and RStudioâ€™s debugger.

## Installation

The examples for this package are contained in the vignette,
`"debugging-test-server"`.
