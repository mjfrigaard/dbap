<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `dbap` is to demonstrate how debugging functions within a shiny application package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/), [`shiny::testServer()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/shiny/html/testServer.html), and RStudio's debugger.

## Installation

The examples for this package are contained in the vignette, `"debugging-test-server"`.
