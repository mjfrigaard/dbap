# `dbap`

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `dbap` is to demonstrate debugging functions within a shiny application package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/), [`shiny::testServer()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/shiny/html/testServer.html), and RStudio's debugger. Check out [this blog post](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/posts/debugging/) for more information. 

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mjfrigaard/dbap")
```

The examples for this package are contained in the vignettes.
